# Emotion-Recognition


Emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion. People vary widely in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively nascent research area. Generally, the technology works best if it uses multiple modalities in context.

## OBJECTIVE :
This is a user friendly software to increase people’s comfort of learning things.
It can be used in Robotics to perform work according to mood of human beings.
The objective of this software is to predict emotion of the individual based on the
photo uploaded to the software.


## Requirement
OpenCV, Tensorflow, Keras and some basic python modules.


## PROJECT SCOPE :
This project can be used for the students to help them in their learning
process i.e. we can give them questions on the behalf of their state such as if
they are happy we can give them the numerical questions to solve and if they
are sad we can ask them for attempting a MCQ.
This project can be used in the Robotics Domain also. Such as a robot
providing services according to the mood of the individual, which can help in
achieving much human level behaviour.


## DESCRIPTION :
This software provides the information about person’s emotions
which is basically Angry, Sad, Happy, Surprise and Neutral. This
software is done with the help of some machine learning and deep
learning libraries such as tensorflow, keras etc. The future scope of
this software is enormous as it can be the building block of a lot of
custom specific software. In this software people can upload a photo
or can take a photo for predicting emotion. The accuracy of this
software to predict emotion is 66%
